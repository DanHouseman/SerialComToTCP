# SerialToTCP
A library serves as a middleware to facilitate data forwarding between TCP/IP clients and serial (COM) port devices. 

Designed to operate in scenarios where data received from network clients needs to be sent to a serial port and vice versa, enabling communication between networked clients and serially connected devices.

# Key components of the library include:

__SerialPortManager:__ Manages interactions with the serial port, including opening and closing the port, as well as reading from and writing to it. It abstracts away the complexity of .NET's SerialPort class, providing simplified asynchronous read and write operations that are essential for efficient data handling in I/O-bound applications.

__TcpConnectionHandler:__ Listens for incoming TCP connections on a specified port and IP address, managing multiple concurrent client connections. For each connection, it facilitates the bidirectional forwarding of data between the TCP client and the serial port, effectively bridging the gap between network-based and serial communication.

__Concurrency and Exception Handling:__ Implements robust concurrency management, allowing the application to handle multiple TCP clients simultaneously without blocking operations. Exception handling mechanisms are integrated to ensure the application can gracefully recover from or log errors related to network and serial port communications.

__Sample Application:__ Included is a sample Console App Project file that implements this library.

Designed for applications requiring integration between network clients and devices connected via serial ports, such as industrial automation systems, telemetry, device monitoring, and control systems. It's structured to support easy integration into larger applications, offering a high degree of modularity, testability, and scalability.
